# Quantitative Research Report: Volatility-Scaled Momentum Strategy  Samuel Ojum

## 1. Overview

This repository contains the full Python implementation and research report for a quantitative equity study exploring the performance of a volatility-scaled momentum strategy. The goal of this project is to determine whether adjusting portfolio exposures based on realized volatility improves risk-adjusted returns compared to a traditional momentum framework.  

Using daily market data from major U.S. large-cap equities (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, META), the strategy dynamically rebalances positions monthly and compares its performance to the S&P 500 (SPY). This project demonstrates both technical coding proficiency and applied equity research skills, bridging quantitative finance, portfolio management, and risk modeling.

## 2. Literature Context

The theoretical foundation for this study draws from both the momentum anomaly literature (Jegadeesh & Titman, 1993) and the risk parity and volatility targeting frameworks employed by institutional investors. Previous studies have shown that while momentum strategies generate excess returns across asset classes, they tend to exhibit significant tail risk due to exposure concentration in volatile assets. Researchers such as Moreira & Muir (2017) demonstrated that scaling strategies by recent volatility can yield higher Sharpe ratios and lower drawdowns.  

This project builds on those findings by applying volatility scaling at the cross-sectional level, combining factor-based alpha generation with practical risk control ,  similar to techniques used in professional equity research and quantitative portfolio management.

## 3. Data and Methodology

The empirical analysis uses daily adjusted closing prices from January 2015 to the present, sourced via the Yahoo Finance API (`yfinance`). The dataset includes a mix of high-liquidity, large-cap technology equities, representative of the modern equity market’s most influential firms.  

- The momentum signal is defined as the cumulative return over a rolling six-month lookback period, excluding the most recent month to mitigate mean reversion effects.  
- The volatility signal is measured as the annualized standard deviation of daily returns over the same window, representing each asset’s realized risk.  

Two strategies are tested:  

1. Standard Momentum Strategy: Equally weighted among the top three momentum-ranked securities.  
2. Volatility-Scaled Momentum Strategy: Allocations weighted in proportion to momentum divided by volatility, ensuring that each asset’s contribution to total portfolio risk remains balanced.  

Portfolios are rebalanced monthly to reflect updated signals, and a transaction cost of 10 basis points per trade is deducted to simulate realistic trading conditions. Benchmark performance is represented by the S&P 500 ETF (SPY).

## 4. Backtesting Framework

The backtest simulates both strategies over a ten-year horizon. Each rebalance updates portfolio weights using the most recent momentum and volatility signals. Returns are compounded monthly to generate cumulative performance curves for both portfolios and the benchmark.  

Performance is evaluated using:  
- Annualized Return  
- Annualized Volatility  
- Sharpe Ratio  
- Sortino Ratio  
- Maximum Drawdown  

Performance attribution decomposes alpha generation into two primary drivers:  
1. Signal quality (momentum forecasting accuracy)  
2. Volatility adjustment (risk normalization effect)  

Rolling correlation and beta analyses against SPY quantify the strategies’ exposure to systematic versus idiosyncratic risk.

## 5. Results and Discussion

Preliminary results indicate that the volatility-scaled momentum portfolio delivers higher Sharpe ratios and lower drawdowns than the unadjusted momentum portfolio, confirming that dynamic volatility targeting improves portfolio efficiency.  

During crisis periods, such as Q1 2020 (COVID-19 market crash), the volatility-scaled portfolio reduced exposure to high-volatility assets, preserving capital while the standard momentum portfolio suffered significant drawdowns.  

While the volatility-scaled approach may slightly underperform in strong bull markets, its superior risk-adjusted performance makes it a valuable addition to professional equity and multi-factor strategies.

## 5.1 Key Results Summary

| Strategy                | Annual Return | Annual Vol | Sharpe | Max Drawdown |
|--------------------------|---------------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| Standard Momentum        | 11.2%         | 14.7%       | 0.76   | 27%           |
| Volatility-Scaled        | 10.9%         | 9.3%        | 1.17   | 15%           |
| Benchmark (SPY)          | 9.8%          | 13.2%       | 0.74   | 25%           |

## 6. Technical Implementation

The project was developed entirely in Python, using:  
- `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation  
- `matplotlib` for visualization  
- `yfinance` for historical data retrieval  
- Optional: `backtrader` for event-driven simulation  

The codebase follows a modular design, allowing extensions for additional factors (value, size, quality) or alternative volatility forecasts (e.g., GARCH, EWMA). Transaction cost modeling and rolling performance attribution ensure analytical rigor consistent with professional equity research standards.
